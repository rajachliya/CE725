"""Finance layer: construction spend -> funding -> sales -> NPV and IRR, for every iteration.

Timeline convention (use the same in the Excel benchmark):
    month 0           = project start: land and approvals are paid here
    month k (k >= 1)  = days (k-1)*30 to k*30 of construction
    completion month  = ceil(project duration / 30)

Cash flows, all in Rs lakh:
    construction spend  each activity's cost spread evenly over its own start..finish days
    overheads           overhead_per_month for every month (or part month) until completion
    risk costs          spread in proportion to construction spend
    collections         presale_share of revenue collected in step with construction progress
                        (construction-linked plan); the rest collected evenly over
                        months_to_sell_after_completion months after completion
    brokerage           brokerage_pct of collections

Funding (equity view):
    month 0 costs (land, approvals) are paid by equity, because banks generally do not fund
    land purchase (TEAM: verify against current RBI rules and log the source)
    any later month with negative project cash flow: debt pays debt_share, equity the rest
    interest accrues monthly on the debt balance and is capitalised (added to the balance);
    interest accrued up to completion = interest during construction (IDC)
    any month with positive project cash flow: first repays debt (cash sweep), rest goes to equity
    any debt left at the end is repaid by equity in the last month

Every rule above is a modelling choice. Record each in the Assumptions tab.
